# General parameters

# Plotting style. Can be one of 'base', 'latex', 'metsymb'
MPL_STYLE: 'base'

# Minimum Sector Altitude, in ft. No cloud layers with a base above this value will be reported
# in the ampycloud METAR messages. Set it to null for no limit.
MSA: null

# Additional distance above the MSA value (in ft) beyond which hits will be ignored (=cropped) by
# ampycloud. This is to ensure that cloud layers with cloud base heights close to the MSA value are
# still detected with the correct densities.
MSA_HIT_BUFFER: 1500

# Max sky coverage (in %) up to which the coverage is considered null.
OKTA_LIM0: 2

# Min sky coverage (in %) down to which the coverage is considered full.
OKTA_LIM8: 99

# Number (in %) of the cloud hit heights (sorted from smallest to highest) to ignore when
# computing the cloud altitude base, taken to be the min altitude of the
# 100-LAYER_BASE_LVL_PERC % remaining points.
BASE_LVL_ALT_PERC: 5

# Number of Slice/Group/Layer points (in %) - starting from the most recent ones -
# to use to compute the cloud base altitude. 30 would use only the 30% youngest hits.
# Set to 100 to use all the points.
BASE_LVL_LOOKBACK_PERC: 100

# LOWESS parameters used to fit Slice/Groups/Layers altitude trends
LOWESS:
    # Fraction of the slice/group/layer points to consider when deriving the LOWESS smooth fit.
    # Values too small will result in overfitting. Values too large will miss rapid
    # altitude fluctuations.
    frac: 0.35
    # Number of LOWESS fitting iterations

# Slicing parameters

# Clustering parameters

    # Time scaling factor (in s)
    dt_scale: 180
    # Boost factor, applied to the slice fluffiness to derive the altitude scaling factor
    fluffiness_boost: 2
    # Range of allowed altitude scaling factor (in ft). The fluffiness_boost will never be allowed
    # to push the alt_scaling beyond this range.

# Layering parameters
LAYERING_PRMS:
    # Minimum okta value below which cluster splitting is not attempted
    min_okta_to_split: 2
    # Minimum separation (in ft) between the mean altitude of identified layers inside groups
    # with a base altitude in the bins set by min_sep_lims. Any layers separated by less than this
    # value will not be split. Any value < than 5 times the vertical resolution of the data will
    # raise a warning, as it may lead to an over-layering of groups. For the ampycloud METAR
    # messages to be consistent with the ICAO rules of layer selection, this should be >=100 ft
    # below 10'000 ft.
    min_sep_vals: [150, 1000]
    # Altitude threshold (in ft) separating the min_sep_val elements.
    # The 0 and + infty extrema will be automatically added to the list by ampycloud.
    # Just list here the intermediate steps.
