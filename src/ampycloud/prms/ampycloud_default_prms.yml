# General parameters

# Plotting style. Can be one of 'base', 'latex', 'metsymb'
MPL_STYLE: 'base'

# Minimum Sector Altitude, in ft above aerodrome level. No cloud layers with a base above this value
# will be reported in the ampycloud METAR messages. Set it to null for no limit.
MSA: null

# Additional distance above the MSA value (in ft) beyond which hits will be ignored (=cropped) by
# ampycloud. This is to ensure that cloud layers with cloud base heights close to the MSA value are
# still detected with the correct densities.
MSA_HIT_BUFFER: 1500

# Max number of hits in a layer to still consider it to be of 0 oktas.
MAX_HITS_OKTA0: 3

# Max number of holes (=non-detection of cloud) in a layer to still consider it to be of 8 oktas.
MAX_HOLES_OKTA8: 1

# Number (in %) of the cloud hit heights (sorted from smallest to highest) to ignore when
# computing the cloud base height, taken to be the min height of the
# 100-LAYER_BASE_LVL_PERC % remaining points.
BASE_LVL_HEIGHT_PERC: 5

# Number of Slice/Group/Layer points (in %) - starting from the most recent ones -
# to use to compute the cloud base height. 30 would use only the 30% youngest hits.
# Set to 100 to use all the points.
BASE_LVL_LOOKBACK_PERC: 100

# If ceilo Ids are set, for any given layer/ group/ slice, ceilos with the corresponding ID
# will be excluded from the base height calculation. If the selection results in an empty layer/ group/
# slice, we go back to using all ceilo hits and ignore the selection. Use this switch if you want
# to localize the height caclulation or if you want to exclude ceilometers of a specific type in the
# height calculation.

# LOWESS parameters used to fit Slice/Groups/Layers height trends
LOWESS:

# Minimum separation (in ft) between the base heights of identified layers inside groups
# with a base height in the bins set by min_sep_lims. Any layers separated by less than this
# value will be remerged into one layer. Any value < than 5 times the vertical resolution of the data will
# raise a warning, as it may lead to an over-layering of groups. For the ampycloud METAR
# messages to be consistent with the ICAO rules of layer selection, this should be >=100 ft
# below 10'000 ft.
MIN_SEP_VALS: [250, 1000]
