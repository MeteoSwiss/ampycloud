The pickle files in this folder contain reference datasets used to test the scientific stability of
ampycloud.

Each filename has the following format:

geoloc_YYYY.MMM.DD-hh.mm.ss_ref-metar.pkl

or alternatively, to set a specific MSA value:

geoloc_YYYY.MMM.DD-hh.mm.ss_ref-metar_MSAXXXXX.pkl


Each file is required to be a CSV ASCII, containing data ready to be fed to
ampycloud.run(), together with the geoloc and ref_dt extracted from the filename.

Simply adding a file to this folder is sufficient to have it processed by the ampycloud test suite.
