# ampycloud:
## A Python package to characterize cloud layers using ceilometer measurements

### Introduction

ampycloud refers to both this Python package and the algorithm in its core. Both are designed to characterize cloud layers (i.e. height and sky coverage fraction) from ceilometer measurements, and specifically: automatic cloud base *hits* measurements.
